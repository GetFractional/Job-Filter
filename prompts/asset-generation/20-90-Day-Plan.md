# 90-Day Plan Prompt (Job Filter)

> Reference: This prompt follows `Asset-Generation-Template.md` output rules.

## PURPOSE
Generate an executive-ready 90-day operating plan that proves you can (1) diagnose truth fast, (2) prioritize leverage, (3) build repeatable systems, and (4) deliver measurable outcomes without inventing data.

---

## INPUTS (Required)
- Research Brief (fetched by Job ID)
- Job Description (explicit requirements checklist)
- Matt-Dimock-Professional-Profile (canonical metrics/tools/scope/voice)
- Job-Hunter-OS-Strategic-Guidelines
- Annual Growth Plan output (Exec Memo, if available)

---

## OUTPUT CONTRACT (HARD)
- Format: executive plan (tight prose + bullets), skimmable by CEO/COO/Hiring Manager
- Length: 900–1,300 words
- Final output: ONLY the plan (no meta, no rubric, no templates, no bracket placeholders)
- Must include:
  1) Executive Summary
  2) Operating Principles (3–5 bullets)
  3) Days 0–7 (orientation + baseline)
  4) Days 8–30 (diagnose + stabilize)
  5) Days 31–60 (build + pilot)
  6) Days 61–90 (scale + systemize)
  7) Success Metrics (Leading + Lagging)
  8) Risks & Mitigations
  9) Stakeholder Cadence (who, when, why)

---

## NON-HALLUCINATION RULES (HARD)
- Never invent metrics (CAC/ROAS/AOV/payback, revenue, margin, conversion rates, headcount, budgets).
- If baselines are missing, state “validated baseline” and describe how you’ll measure it.
- Only use numeric targets if explicitly supported by the Research Brief or Matt’s profile.
- JD must-haves must be addressed OR flagged as not covered (brief reason).

---

## PROCESS (DETERMINISTIC)
### Step 1 — Extract JD Must-Haves (Ground Truth)
Build internal checklist:
- Primary responsibilities
- Required channels/tools
- Required leadership scope
- “Must have/required” items

### Step 2 — Align to Company Reality (from Research Brief)
Identify:
- Growth constraint(s)
- Measurement constraint(s)
- Operational constraint(s)
- Risk/regulatory constraint(s), if any

### Step 3 — Draft Plan with Clear Deliverables
Each period must include:
- Deliverables (what exists at the end)
- Decisions (what decisions get made)
- Cadence (how work is governed)
- Evidence (what data validates success)

### Step 4 — Self-Check
- All required sections present
- JD must-haves addressed or flagged
- No invented numbers
- Clear operator tone (Action → Method → Impact)
