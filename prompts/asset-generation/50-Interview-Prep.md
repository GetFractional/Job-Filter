# Interview Prep Pack Prompt (Job Filter)

> Reference: This prompt follows `Asset-Generation-Template.md` output rules.

## PURPOSE
Create a comprehensive interview prep pack that increases close rate by giving Matt:
- A crisp narrative
- A strategy thesis
- A story bank with proof
- A 30/60/90 operating view
- Objection handling
- Smart questions to ask
- Compensation negotiation prep

---

## INPUTS (Required)
- Research Brief (fetched by Job ID)
- Job Description (explicit requirements checklist)
- Matt-Dimock-Professional-Profile (canonical metrics/tools/scope/voice)
- Annual Growth Plan output (Exec Memo, if available)
- 90-Day Plan output (if available)

---

## OUTPUT CONTRACT (HARD)
- Format: structured prep pack with headings + bullets
- Length: 1,200–2,000 words (ok to be longer than other assets, but keep it tight)
- Final output: ONLY the prep pack (no meta, no rubric, no templates, no bracket placeholders)
- Must include:
  1) Role Thesis (1 paragraph)
  2) “What I’d do first” (first 30 days, 6–10 bullets)
  3) JD Must-Haves Map (requirement → proof)
  4) Story Bank (6–10 stories)
  5) Likely Questions + Winning Answers (10–15)
  6) Objections & Responses (6–10)
  7) Questions Matt Should Ask (10–15)
  8) Take-Home / Case Study Outline (if relevant)
  9) Compensation Strategy (anchoring + tradeoffs)

---

## NON-HALLUCINATION RULES (HARD)
- Never invent company metrics, budgets, headcount, margins, CAC, etc.
- Only use factual proof points from Matt’s profile.
- When a detail is unknown, label it as “validate” and propose how to validate.
- JD must-haves must be covered in the map or flagged.

---

## PROCESS (DETERMINISTIC)
### Step 1 — Extract JD Must-Haves
Create a checklist of:
- Channels, tools, responsibilities, seniority, leadership scope, expected outcomes

### Step 2 — Build Requirement → Proof Map
For each must-have:
- Evidence from Matt’s profile (Action → Method → Impact)
- If missing, flag gap and propose mitigation strategy (without claiming it’s already true)

### Step 3 — Build Story Bank
Stories must be:
- Situation → Constraint → Actions → Systems → Result → Lesson
- Quantified only where proof exists

### Step 4 — Build Objections and Q/A
Make responses:
- Direct, confident, non-fluffy
- System-oriented
- Tied back to the operating plan

### Step 5 — Build Comp Strategy
Create a negotiation approach:
- anchor logic
- defensible value narrative
- tradeoffs (base/bonus/equity/title/remote/benefits)

---
