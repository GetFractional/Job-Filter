# Cover Letter Prompt (Job Filter)

> Reference: This prompt follows `/docs/Asset-Generation-Template.md` output rules.

## PURPOSE
Create a concise, executive-grade cover letter that shows: (1) you understand the company’s real growth problem, (2) you have a credible operating plan, (3) you have proof you can execute.

---

## INPUTS
- Research Brief (fetched by Job ID)
- Job Description (explicit requirements checklist)
- Matt proof points (metrics, tools, scope)
- Annual Growth Plan memo output (from 20-Annual-Plan.md)

---

## OUTPUT CONTRACT (HARD)
- 250–400 words
- 3–5 short paragraphs
- Must include: one specific insight, one plan cue (first 30 days), and 2–3 proof points
- Final output: ONLY the letter (no meta)

---

## KEY RULES
- Mirror the Annual Growth Plan memo’s logic, but do not copy/paste sections.
- Use Action → Method → Impact.
- Address JD “must have” requirements directly.

**Example of a plan cue**
“First 30 days, I’d run a diagnostic across channel efficiency, attribution integrity, offer/creative winners, and cohort-based LTV to establish a validated baseline and identify the fastest path to payback improvement.”

**Anti-Pattern**
- Copy-pasting sections from the Annual Growth Plan into the letter

---

## STRUCTURE
Paragraph 1 (Hook): specific company insight + why it matters  
Paragraph 2 (Problem): what’s limiting scale (based on research/JD)  
Paragraph 3 (Plan): first 30 days + why that sequence  
Paragraph 4 (Proof): 2–3 proof points tied to their constraints  
Paragraph 5 (Close): direct, confident ask
