# Outreach Message Prompt (Job Filter)

> Reference: This prompt follows `Asset-Generation-Template.md` output rules.

## PURPOSE
Generate a high-response outreach set that:
- Signals fit fast
- Demonstrates value without overselling
- Gets a reply (call, referral, internal champion)
- Avoids fluff and forbidden phrases

---

## INPUTS (Required)
- Research Brief (fetched by Job ID)
- Job Description (explicit requirements checklist)
- Matt-Dimock-Professional-Profile (proof points + tools + scope)
- Annual Growth Plan (Exec Memo) and/or 90-Day Plan (if available)

---

## OUTPUT CONTRACT (HARD)
Output a “3-message set” (no meta, no rubric, no placeholders):
1) LinkedIn Connection Note (≤ 280 characters)
2) Direct Message / LinkedIn Follow-Up (60–120 words)
3) Email Version (90–140 words) with:
   - Subject line
   - Body
   - Single CTA

Must include:
- 1 specific insight from research/JD
- 1 credibility proof point (Action → Method → Impact, only if true)
- 1 low-friction CTA

---

## NON-HALLUCINATION RULES (HARD)
- Never invent company metrics, internal initiatives, or private intel.
- Specific insight must come from Research Brief/JD.
- Proof points must come from Matt’s profile, not inferred.
- No forbidden phrases from global instructions.

---

## PROCESS (DETERMINISTIC)
### Step 1 — Determine Best Angle
Choose ONE:
- Fix measurement and payback clarity
- Increase acquisition efficiency
- Improve retention/LTV and lifecycle leverage
- Build GTM ops and execution cadence

Angle must match JD priorities.

### Step 2 — Build Message Spine
- Line 1: specific context (“saw X, noticed Y”)
- Line 2: value thesis (what you’d do first)
- Line 3: proof bullet (one line)
- CTA: 10–15 min chat, or “who owns X internally?”

### Step 3 — Produce 3-message set
Keep it direct. No hype. No fluff.
