# Annual Growth Plan Prompt (EXEC MEMO — Default)

> Reference: This prompt follows `/docs/Asset-Generation-Template.md` output rules.

## PURPOSE
Generate an executive-ready Annual Growth Plan memo that proves strategic clarity and operator-level execution. It must be skimmable by CEO/COO and credible without invented data.

---

## INPUTS (Required)
- Research Brief (fetched by Job ID)
- Job Description (explicit requirements checklist)
- Matt’s profile / proof points (canonical metrics, tools, scope)
- Job Filter Strategic Guidelines (voice + constraints)

---

## OUTPUT CONTRACT (HARD)
**Format**: Executive memo (headings + tight paragraphs + bullets)  
**Length**: 900–1,400 words  
**Audience**: CEO/COO/Hiring Manager skim  
**Final output**: ONLY the memo. No rubric, no meta, no templates.

### REQUIRED SECTION ORDER (DO NOT CHANGE)
1) Title Block
2) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
3) Strategic Imperative (single sentence)
4) 30-DAY DIAGNOSTIC
5) YEAR 1: BUILD AND SCALE PREDICTABLE GROWTH
   - Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 each with:
     - Actions (4–7 bullets)
     - Outcomes (Confidence) (3–5 bullets)
6) KEY ASSUMPTIONS
7) RISKS AND MITIGATION
8) YEAR 2–3: STRATEGIC VISION
9) WHY MATT

---

## NON-HALLUCINATION DATA POLICY (HARD)
- Never invent CAC/ROAS/AOV/payback, channel mix, margins, revenue numbers, headcount, or tool stack details.
- If numeric baselines are missing:
  - Put them in the 30-DAY DIAGNOSTIC “Output” line as “validated baseline”.
- Only use directional ranges if explicitly supported in the Research Brief (e.g., “10–15% CAC improvement”).
- If the JD demands a model/pro forma:
  - Produce the memo, and add a single bullet under Risks: “JD requests financial model; requires baseline inputs not present. Deliverable: model after diagnostic baseline.”

---

## PROCESS (DETERMINISTIC)
### Step 1 — Extract JD requirements (Ground Truth)
- List “must have” responsibilities, required channels, tools, seniority expectations.
- These must be addressed in the memo OR explicitly flagged as not covered.

### Step 2 — Build Memo Skeleton (PASS 1)
Output headings in the required order with bullet placeholders only.
Self-check:
- All required headings exist.
- Each quarter has Actions + Outcomes (Confidence).

### Step 3 — Render the Memo (PASS 2)
Convert skeleton into final memo:
- Tight executive prose, minimal fluff
- Concrete operating moves
- Explicit cadence and measurement where possible

### Step 4 — JD Coverage Check
Confirm each JD “must have” is:
- Addressed, OR
- Flagged with a brief reason

### Step 5 — Final Output Rule
Return ONLY the memo.
